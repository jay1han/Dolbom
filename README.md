# Dolbom

This project generates three artifacts:

- An Android app
- A Watchface (under `./Watchface`)
- A Watchapp (under `./Watchapp`)

The Watchapp is optional if you don't use the *Quiet mode* and *Find my phone* features.

To work with the Android app, load the project in Android Studio at the root.
For the Watchface and the Watchapp, please see the respective READMEs.
