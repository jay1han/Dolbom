# App code critique

This is my first "useful" Android app written from scratch.
While the coding style is relatively clean and Kotlin-idiomatic,
some usages of the Android SDK seem a bit clunky.

## Permissions

## Composition and state

## UI and Graphics

## The `Pebble` object

## The `Notifications` object

## Other tricks and kludges

### `UiNotifications.getApplicationIcon()` function
